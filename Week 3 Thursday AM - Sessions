HTTP Protocol ->  Stateless, doesn't store any data about transactions. Uses less data, memory without a state.

Sessions

Meant to be destroyed later.
Can include multiple transactions

One way to send a session value: Within query string parameters.
http://abc.com/?session_id=1234 <-- Insecure, anyone could use session_id parameter.

Cookies are a better way. Can have a certain amount of data - 4kb. Have to be careful how much information is sent.
Request has a header and a body <-- Cookies are a part of the header.

Use session.inspect to look at the session in terminal.

Sessions are hashes, can attach key/value pairs to them.

Don't attach objects to sessions.
Work out how to test session functionality with Cucumber/Capybara
