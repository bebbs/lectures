Composition - Classes are composed of objects (everything within them.)
            - A larger object composed of many smaller objects.
            - A Car class is *composed* of it's engine, doors, etc.
          
            
Encapsulation - Class A shouldn't have access to the working parts of Class B.
              - @instance variables available across the whole class. Variables available only within their scope.
              - Car class passes on message to the engine rather than User > engine directly.

Inheritance - 'Is a -' relationships.
            - Trickle down of methods from parent classes.
