Recursion:

def palindrome word
  return true if word.length <= 1      << Chance to exit the method.
  return false if word.slice!(-1) != word.slice!(0)
  palindrome word << Recurses through again.
end

Using slice! to permanently alter word.
(-1) index from last char of the string.

Factorial: 

Factorial of 5 = 5x4x3x2x1 = 120

def factorial(number)
  return 1 if number == 1
  number * (factorial(number-1))
end
