Open and test array class.

An enumerator is something that can be iterated over.

inject == reduce

describe the array
context with a block
write an expectation for everything that inject can already do (+, -, * etc.)

use self
iterate over self?

def my_inject 
  puts block.call
    self.each do |item|
      yield memo, item
    end
  end
end

copy = self.dup

Takeaway -> Inject for adding up totals?
