Parameters
  Within a form => action = address it is sent to, method = post, get, put etc.
  Use forms to post parameters to actions
  puts params in terminal to list all posted parameters
  params[:passed_through] syntax
  
  @ instance variables in Sinatra aren't actually instance variables. They can be used to pass variables through to erb views.
  
  <%= Ruby code that gets displayed %>
  <% Ruby code that doesn't get displayed. %> <- Useful for conditionals etc.
  
  Use post for secure information. Get sends everything as query string parameters.
  
  Get requests shouldn't be dependent on URL parameters being passed in.
  
  Query string parameters - Anything sent through a URL can be manipulated within a get request. => Expedia
  
  get '/hello/:first/:name' do     => Kayak
    @first = params[:first]
    @name = params[:name]
  end
  
  
Partials

  <%= erb :form %>
  Reusable snippets of code -> DRY principle

    erb :1, layout: :'xyz'    <- Call from a different layout (or false) to layout.erb 
  end
